The goal of the project was to redesign the homepage of [Pepiniere 27 website](http://www.pepiniere27.fr/). After doing the design on Figma, I decided to develop it by myself in order to truly do the project until the end.<br>
It was a great challenge to practice responsive design, as well as a responsive navbar with JavaScript. I still have to work on the disply on IOS devices since it is not displayed as on an Android device (cta, margins, some colors).


### Figma

You can find below the Figma we created with my group. It was a great challenge to practice responsive design, as well as a responsive navbar with JavaScript.
